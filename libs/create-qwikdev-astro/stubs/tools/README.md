# [@QwikDev/astro](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro) Starter Kit

## Overview

Welcome to the [@QwikDev/astro](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro) starter kit! This kit enables seamless integration of Qwik components into your Astro projects, combining the efficiency of Qwik's component-based architecture with the flexibility of Astro's static site generation.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) + [Astro](https://astro.build/) project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ astro.svg
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ qwik.svg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ counter.module.css
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ counter.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ globals.css
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

- **public/** : This directory contains static resources such as images, accessible from the root of your deployed site.

- **src/** : This directory is the core of your Qwik + Astro application. Here's an overview of its structure:

  - **assets/** : This directory is for resources such as images, SVG files, etc.
  - **components/** : Qwik components are stored here. Use this directory to organize and create reusable components for your application.
  - **layouts/** : Astro layouts reside in this directory. Layout files define the overall structure of your pages.
  - **pages/** : This directory contains the pages of your Astro application. Each file with the `.astro` or `.md` extension is exposed as a route based on its file name.
  - **styles/** : Global style files for your application are stored here, such as `globals.css`.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

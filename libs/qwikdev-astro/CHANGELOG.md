## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 8d93389: Simplifies internals

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- 01db52b: Fix unresolved module handling and update build tooling

  ### Fixes

  - Return `null` instead of throwing on unresolved modules in `resolveId`

  ### Chore

  - Migrate build tooling from `tsup` to `tsdown`

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 2af2e4a: feat: support global config for renderOpts

  You can now pass the `renderOpts` option to the `qwik` integration to set global render options for all Qwik components.

  For example, let's say we wanted to change the base URL for all Qwik build assets on every component used in an Astro file.

  ```ts
  import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
  import qwik from "@qwik.dev/astro";

  export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [
      qwik({ include: "**/qwik/*", renderOpts: { base: "my-cdn-url/build" } }),
    ],
  });
  ```

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 7d7b656: feat: Support Qwik Render Options at runtime on a per-component basis.

  This is useful for scenarios where you want to render a Qwik component in an Astro page, but you want to use a different base URL for the Qwik component, or another configuration.

  For example, if you want to render a Qwik component in an Astro page, but you want to use a different base URL for the Qwik component, you can pass the `renderOpts` prop to the Qwik component.

  ```astro
  <NativeCounter initial={2} renderOpts={{ base: "http://0.0.0.0:4321/build" }} />
  ```

  Make sure to import the `RenderOptions` type from `@builder.io/qwik/server` and pass it to the component for type safety.

  Want to make a change for all components? Create a global object config and pass it to each component.
